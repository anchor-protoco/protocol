# Pitch

Professional accelerator-style presentation framework designed to win over judges in 5 minutes or less

#### The 5-Minute Accelerator Pitch Formula

Your goal in this phase: Get judges excited about your project and convinced it deserves to win.

> ![⚡](<Base64-Image-Removed>) ACTION REQUIRED
> Judges see dozens of pitches. You have 30 seconds to hook them, then 4.5 minutes to convince them. Every second counts.

#### The Golden Rule of Judge Psychology

Start Simple, Build Complexity: Begin with something every judge immediately understands, then gradually reveal the sophistication of your approach. Never lead with complex technical details - judges need to care before they’ll try to understand.

#### The 5-Stage Pitch Structure

#### Stage 1: The Hook (30 seconds)

Goal: Create immediate emotional investment

Start with one of these proven opening strategies:

Option A - Personal Problem Story
\> ![📋](<Base64-Image-Removed>) EXAMPLE
\> “Three weeks ago, my teammate tried to set up a crypto wallet for the first time. After 45 minutes of confusion and two failed transactions, she said ‘This is why normal people don’t use blockchain.’ That’s the problem we’re solving.”

Option B - Shocking Market Reality
\> ![📋](<Base64-Image-Removed>) EXAMPLE
\> “97% of people who try to use DeFi give up within their first week. We built the solution that keeps them engaged.”

Option C - Bold Future Vision
\> ![📋](<Base64-Image-Removed>) EXAMPLE
\> “Imagine if using Bitcoin was as simple as sending a text message. We’re making that reality.”

> ![💡](<Base64-Image-Removed>) TIP
> AI Prompt for Hook Generation:
>
> "Help me create 3 different 30-second opening hooks for my hackathon pitch about \[your solution\]. Each should immediately grab attention using either: 1) a relatable personal story, 2) a surprising statistic, or 3) a bold future vision. Make them emotional and accessible to non-technical judges."
>
> ​

#### Stage 2: Problem Validation (1 minute)

Goal: Prove this problem is worth solving

Framework: Problem → Cost → Current Solutions Fail → Opportunity

> ![📋](<Base64-Image-Removed>) SLIDE TEMPLATE
> Slide Title: “The Problem”
>
> Who: \[Specific user group\]
>
> What: \[Specific frustration/cost\]
>
> Evidence: \[Data point or user quote\]
>
> Why Now: \[Why existing solutions don’t work\]

Key Elements to Include:
\- Specific user group (not “everyone”)
\- Quantified pain (time, money, frustration)
\- Proof from your validation phase
\- Why now is the right time

> ![💡](<Base64-Image-Removed>) TIP
> AI Prompt for Problem Articulation:
>
> "Help me clearly articulate the problem my solution addresses. Structure it as: Who specifically experiences this problem, what it costs them, evidence that it's real, and why current solutions fail. Based on my validation research: \[insert your validation findings\]"
>
> ​

#### Stage 3: Solution Demo (2 minutes)

Goal: Show your solution works and is differentiated

Demo Strategy: Show, don’t tell. Let your working application speak for itself.

Structure:
1\. Quick Overview (20 seconds): “Here’s what we built”
2\. Live Demo (90 seconds): Walk through core user flow
3\. Key Differentiator (10 seconds): “Unlike X, our solution does Y”

Demo Best Practices:
\- Practice your demo 50+ times
\- Have screenshots ready in case of technical failures
\- Focus on user experience, not technical architecture
\- Show the “magic moment” where value becomes obvious

> ![⚠️](<Base64-Image-Removed>) WARNING
> Demo Killers to Avoid:
> \- Apologizing for unfinished features
> \- Explaining code instead of showing user value
> \- Spending time on setup/configuration
> \- Demonstrating features that don’t solve the core problem

> ![💡](<Base64-Image-Removed>) TIP
> AI Prompt for Demo Script:
>
> "Help me create a 90-second demo script for my application. Focus on the user journey from problem to solution. Here's what my app does: \[describe functionality\]. The core value is: \[main benefit\]. Write it as if I'm walking a judge through the experience step by step."
>
> ​

#### Stage 4: Market Opportunity (1 minute)

Goal: Prove this can be big

Framework: Market Size → Traction Indicators → Growth Strategy

> ![📋](<Base64-Image-Removed>) SLIDE TEMPLATE
> Slide Title: “Market Opportunity”
>
> Market Size: \[Bottom-up calculation\]
>
> Early Validation: \[User feedback, engagement metrics\]
>
> Growth Plan: \[How you’ll scale from hackathon MVP\]

What Judges Want to See:
\- Realistic market sizing (bottom-up, not top-down)
\- Evidence people actually want this
\- Clear path from MVP to sustainable business
\- Understanding of competitive landscape

> ![💡](<Base64-Image-Removed>) TIP
> AI Prompt for Market Analysis:
>
> "Help me size the market opportunity for my solution realistically. My target users are \[specific group\] and my solution addresses \[specific problem\]. Create a bottom-up market calculation and identify 3 growth strategies that could scale this from a hackathon project to a real business."
>
> ​

#### Stage 5: The Ask (30 seconds)

Goal: Make it clear what you want and why you deserve it

Framework: What You Want → Why You → Next Steps

> ![📋](<Base64-Image-Removed>) SLIDE TEMPLATE
> Slide Title: “The Ask”
>
> Request: \[Specific prize/recognition you’re seeking\]
>
> Why Us: \[Unique team strengths\]
>
> Next Steps: \[What you’ll do if you win\]

Key Elements:
\- Be specific about what you want
\- Connect your team’s background to the problem
\- Show you have a plan beyond the hackathon
